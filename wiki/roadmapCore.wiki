#summary roadmap for the Mortar system and the Mortar module
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

This document is the official roadmap for the project. Features for upcoming versions, their expected release dates, and their owners are listed below. This document is focused purely on new features- bug fixes and smaller changes are ongoing and should be expected with every release.

As this document is the official Roadmap it should only be updated by release owners. Feature requests can be added through the issue tracker (and please feel free to add any ideas you might have), and discussion of the roadmap (or anything else for that matter) should be directed to the development list.
