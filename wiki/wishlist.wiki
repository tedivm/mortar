#summary A list of things we want.

= Introduction =

The goal of this document is to list isolated classes or tools that are not available inside of Mortar (or any modules) that would be useful.


= Details =

== Word Stemmer ==

A simple word stemmer class would be great for tagging and other data mining type stuff. There are a ton of examples out there of how to do this, but the PHP ones are all proprietary or have strong copyleft. Here are some [http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/ examples] that may serve as a starting point. Do not just copy them, as they are copyrighted and such; use them as a guideline for how to make it yourself.

== Diff ==

A class to compare two versions of a document (say, the wiki or cms revisions) is seriously needed at this point.

== Filters ==

Right now we're mostly using the filter_var php functions, but we could use something more flexible. This shouldn't just filter but also validate, so using the form validation classes as a starting point may be a good idea.

== Admin Interfaces ==

An extendable set of classes should be created which control the content of admin pages which have no equivalent on the front end, and methods for interacting with certain key elements (users, groups, sites, configuration) should be introduced.

== Modifiable Pretty URLs == 

A system to actually let you define the structure for URLs (either overall or on a per-directory/per-group level) based on key elements of each model (to allow for automatic SEO URLs in addition to slug-based page names.)

== Cascading Settings ==

If we have global settings that can be overridden on a local level, we need to implement a UI mechanism for clearly indicating _where_ a given setting originates, allowing someone viewing info on a given area to see which settings are set locally, which are set in a parent, and which are set globally.
