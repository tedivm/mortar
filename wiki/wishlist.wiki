#summary A list of things we want.

= Introduction =

The goal of this document is to list isolated classes or tools that are not available inside of Mortar (or any modules) that would be useful.

== Word Stemmer ==

A simple word stemmer class would be great for tagging and other data mining type stuff. There are a ton of examples out there of how to do this, but the PHP ones are all proprietary or have strong copyleft. Here are some [http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/ examples] that may serve as a starting point. Do not just copy them, as they are copyrighted and such; use them as a guideline for how to make it yourself.

== Diff ==

A class to compare two versions of a document (say, the wiki or cms revisions) is seriously needed at this point.

== Filters ==

Right now we're mostly using the filter_var php functions, but we could use something more flexible. This shouldn't just filter but also validate, so using the form validation classes as a starting point may be a good idea.
