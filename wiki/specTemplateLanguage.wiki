Here is a brainstormed and completely non-binding list of tags that the language should support:

===Page Segments===

{# head #}
- Retrieves the HTML head, complete with all relevant information provided by the system.

{# footer #}
- Retrieves footer content.

{# menu @1 #}
- Retrieves the HTML contents of the menu or sidebar designated by @1, in _ul_ form.

===Location Content===

{# posts @1 @2 etc. #}
- Retrieves X posts from the current location, with optional filters, and displays each in template @1. (Maybe have a capture -> dupe mechanism for this?)

{# query_posts @1 @2 etc. #}
- Retrieves posts from anywhere, based on a list of filter/search criteria, and displays each in template (as above).

===Model Content===

{# model_name #}

{# model_title #}

{# model_content #}

{# model_owner #}

{# model_type #}

{# model_creationTime #}

{# model_lastModified #}

{# model_actions #}

(These elements are currently supplied by ModelToHtml.)

{# model_tags #}

{# model_propertyX #}

(These elements _should_ be supplied by ModelToHtml eventually.)

===Navigation===

{# next @1 @2 etc. #}
-Returns the URL for the "next" item. (By default the next item by date with the same parent, but can be filtered or expanded by args.)

{# prev @1 @2 etc. #}
-Returns the URL for the "previous" item. (By default the previous item by date with the same parent, but can be filtered or expanded by args.)

{# first @1 @2 etc. #}
-Returns the URL for the "first" item. (By default the first item by date with the same parent, but can be filtered or expanded by args.)

{# last @1 @2 etc. #}
-Returns the URL for the "last" item. (By default the last item by date with the same parent, but can be filtered or expanded by args.)

===Local Info===

{# theme_url #}

===Feeds===

===Gallery/Media===

===Meta===

{# login #}

===Logic===

mathematical ops, comparators, if/then, looping -- do we want to handle this in PHP or allow it in templates?
